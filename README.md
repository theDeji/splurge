# Splurge - Expo + Expo Router + Redux Toolkit + AsyncStorage (TypeScript)

This project is a small buyer app demonstrating product list, product detail, cart with quantity controls and persistence.

## Features

- Product list (mock data)
- Product detail
- Cart: add/remove/update quantity
- Cart persistence via AsyncStorage (default) â€” works with Expo Go
- Navigation with Expo Router
- Redux Toolkit for state management
- TypeScript
- Filtering Products by Price

## Setup (quick)

1. Install deps: `npm install`
2. Run: `expo start` or `npm run ios` and `npm run android` for direct app start up
3. Open in Expo Go on your device or run on simulator.

## Notes on What I'd Improve if given more time

- Improve the Product List screen by adding a search functionality
- Add account management to help keep track of order history
- Work on a better theme
- Add a global font for the app
- Make a quick "add to car" feature from Product List Screen
- Add a Splash screen and onboarding flow with Login/Sign Up functionalities
- Add pagination on product screen
